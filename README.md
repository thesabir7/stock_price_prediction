# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices based on historical market data. We demonstrate a basic prediction model using Apple Inc. (`AAPL`) stock data fetched via Yahoo Finance.

## 🧠 Features

- Real-time stock data fetching using `yfinance`
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Stock price forecasting using Random Forest Regressor
- Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices
